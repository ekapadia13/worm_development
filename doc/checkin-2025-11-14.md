# Check-in 2
**Date:** November 14, 2025

## Prior Feedback
- You told us we were good <3

## New Progress & Struggles and Questions
- We haven't been able to advance as far as we would like, due to getting stuck at the filtering and quality control steps. We have managed to curate our own lists of mitochondrial genes and ribosomal genes, due to having found the author's supplemental details lacking in quality and content.
- We started out trying to work with monocle3, however, monocle3 doesn't install well if you aren't using a freshly installed R (also based on previous experience). Therefore, we are pivoting away from monocle3 and trying to use Seurat, which is a package already installed on our laptops
- We also realized that all our salmon files were overridding each other, which is why we only have one output file called quant.sf. We are changing our code so that we have quant.sf files for all our files.

## Next Steps
- Now that we are using Seurat, we are trying to figure out how to (1) load our quant.sf files (2) how to filter out genes which we have identified as mitochondrial or ribosomal (3) and finally generate our UMAP to show the different clusters of genes.

## Project Organization
Directory organization:
- Scripts in worm_development/analysis
- Raw data in worm_development/data/rawdata
- Processed data in worm_development/data/processeddata
- Transcript and index in worm_development/index
- Check ins in worm_development/doc
Workload distribution:
- For our project, we each perform the analyses individually, but we do it together so we can make sure we are both getting the experience and learning how to do the analyses and can be there to help each other when needed.
